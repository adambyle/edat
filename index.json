By the time Voyager reaches the nearest star outside our solar system, it is very likely that humanity will be long gone.\nAt that point in time, humanity will no longer take a physical form. We will be signals radiating out into space—our telephone calls, radio broadcasts, text messages, and voice memos the remnants of our being.\nThe album’s opening track, %4K462KpNKJKaqo4Nw4v0Xm%, serves as our first signal: a declaration by a woman to an unknown recipient that, despite the silence and the distance between them, she will always love them. And <i>We Will Always Love You</i> gives <i>always</i> the highest meaning it could possibly have—the <i>always</i> that carries this declaration of love endlessly through space for all time."

And <i>We Will Always Love You</i> gives <i>always</i> the highest meaning it could possibly have—the <i>always</i> that carries this declaration of love endlessly through space for all time.\nAn exhaustive ode to the Voyager mission, from its cover art to its celestial themes, <i>WWALY</i> leaves a lot of emotional space to fill for its musical content—but the Avalanches succeed without making it feel lofty, saccharine, or over-ambitious. Every track, as a cross-section of human emotion, hits that much more deeply in the context of the album’s premise.\nThe Avalanches return with their sampling prowess. Like before, many samples come from decades past, from songs that never gained much attention, weaving musical “junk” into a tapestry of unique sounds. But there is one exception: The album’s first single, %51wxtCuipwjvvT99wsSmCc%, turns the Roche sisters and their %3cPtZw0oqMEkKlGSF0SLkc% into an otherworldly choir.\nThe album <i>sounds</i> like earth as heard from space. While tracks like %4k65ndzxH3tHYZSnYurgM7%, %4k65ndzxH3tHYZSnYurgM%, and %2CwjJUzjEYq6CbIYTytZTe% transmit the sounds of human struggle, %4PUGAmAvt5VxbbefkhV0x5% and %3BjcCLvgi6anh2xcRnBerE%  reach a little higher with pop-y refrains on love. The Avalanches return to their dance roots with tracks like %4o8ssGZ37z8S93zHTNfDlD% and %5FI0R5JDimbYBMbMCGhWYV%.\nEvery song on the album tells its own story, which was only made possible by the album’s vast and diverse guest roster. The chorus of voices on this album, whether in the background vocals that haunt nearly every track or in the variety of leads, make each “signal” feel important, each carrying a breath of humanity that one feels sad to lose when the album reaches its close.\nThe morse code on the final track is the Arecibo message, a transmission into space carrying information about humans and our planet—an overt symbol of all the music before it, almost as if the vibrant, musical signals of <i>WWALY</i> were distilled back into a characterless, voiceless radio transmission. Indeed, we hear the choir’s voices come back briefly only to fade away in the final moments of the song."

Sampling is common in the music world for making beats and setting backing tracks. The Avalanches take it a step further, and then a dozen steps more. Each song on the album is made of over fifty samples, with six or seven being layered on top of each other at any given point. Author Nick Hornby has said, “The Avalanches use so many samples to create something so indisputably their own that to accuse them of plagiarism is pointless.”\nThe album’s title track, %1AAYbsAIgEJMbxgLgpjE9y% captures everything special about this type of music and sets the tone for an adventure of an album. The doo-wop vocal backing and delicate string and flute hook feel iconic after only a couple listens. The song and the album as a whole are reminiscent of a journey abroad; the lyrics are obscured to be intentionally ambiguous about the narrator’s experience (“Since I left/met you, I found the world so new”).\nThe Avalanches have stated that the album is about a journey around the world in pursuit of a lost lover.\nThe sounds of the album are diverse and eclectic. Some of the strangest, like %60pbRwtQ2b7RYGDnfUGqPP% and %3mPJHVpCvzykoxmWnYdnFq% have found popularity with fans for their unique sound, even if I don’t enjoy them as much. But the Avalanches’ imaginative sampling is once again to thank for these inventive sounds that nobody else could have made—and listening to the samples’ sources, you could’ve never pictured them working together in this way until hearing it firsthand.\n%7bKkIsUZ6sb5Lt73oNTLUw% and %6hQ4FNfbxDiETvXAgHMGp9% invoke sounds familiar to fans of dance music and source from ’70s disco in large quantities.\nWhat ties the album together in between these odd and interesting tracks are the lighter songs that return the album to its theme of chasing love around the globe. I get easily sentimental when it comes to that kind of music, so I fall victim to these songs in particular. I see %6loJHm0hdjgNYB10uiY2aD% and %3rjzK68me0fijMFGJ1G2Wk% as great services to the overall theme, necessary chill moments in the experience, and overall underrated tracks by fans of the album.\nI can’t overstate how delightful it is to pick up on motifs and clips of samples you heard earlier in the album, used later in an entirely new way. Sometimes I put it on because I’m a sucker for dance music, and other times I want to intellectually appreciate the unmatchable craftsmanship put into this album. I sympathize with the elitists on this one. And it’s so easy to sit down, put on the first song, and end up listening all the way through because it has been made so seamlessly—it is, in many senses, one big song just split into tracks because that’s the conventional way to publish music.\nI am always surprised that an album so strange, dance-y, and lyrically repetitive can hit with consistent emotional quality. It is my interpretation that this album has a bittersweet ending: In %7lclmN7bzT9nfIPQCupKc4%, the narrator laments, “I’m trying, but I just can’t get you / ever since the day I left you.” That while this journey, full of unique experiences and, for us as the listener, vibrant and fascinating sonic landscapes, may not have been in vain, there was something lost that can never be regained. Maybe what was lost was my unbreakable state of captivation listening to this masterpiece for the first time. I will never get it back."
